I have the basic code for generating rule 110 and generating the plots,
But I still need to do the stuff below

slide a window from 3 to len(row) / 2 across each iteration
track the coverage of unique integers found 
compute coverage: (number of distinct windows seen up to time t) / 2^n

start with a size 1 window, where window size is n
slide across until you until you find all 2^n numbers
then increment n by 1
don't increment n if there are any numbers not found
